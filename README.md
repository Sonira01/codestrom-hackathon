# Cancer(Brain Tumor) Detection System

This project is a comprehensive Cancer Detection System designed to assist in the early identification and classification of cancer using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system is structured to support both backend model development and a frontend user interface.

## Features

- **Automated Cancer Detection:**  
  Utilizes advanced machine learning models to analyze medical images and predict the presence of cancer.

- **Support for Multiple Cancer Types:**  
  The system is modular and can be extended to detect various types of cancer (e.g., glioma, breast cancer).

- **Jupyter Notebook Integration:**  
  Includes notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation, especially in the `Testing/glioma/` directory.

- **Frontend Interface:**  
  A separate `frontend/` directory (ignored in version control) is used for the user-facing application.

## Project Structure

- `data/`  
  Contains datasets used for training and testing. This folder is ignored in version control to protect sensitive data.

- `Training/`  
  Stores training scripts and related files. The `.gitkeep` file ensures the directory exists in the repository.

- `Testing/glioma/`  
  Contains Jupyter notebooks for testing and validating the glioma detection models.

- `frontend/`  
  Houses the frontend application code (ignored in version control).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sonira01/codestrom-hackathon.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Follow the instructions in the relevant backend or frontend directories.

3. **Run the Model:**  
   Use the provided notebooks or scripts to train and test the cancer detection models.
